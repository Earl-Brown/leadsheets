{Title: At The Cross (Alternative chords)}
{Artist: Randy and Terry Buttler}

{Verse}
[D]I know a [C]place, a [G]wonderful [D]place
Where a[D]ccused and con[C]demned
Find [G]mercy and [D]grace
Where the [D]wrongs we have [C]done
And the [G]wrongs done to [D]us
Were [D]nailed there with [C]Him
[G]There on the [D]cross

{Chorus: 2x second time}
At the [C]cross, (At the [G]cross)
He [F]died for our [D]sin
At the [C]cross, (At the [G]cross)
He [F]gave us life a[D]gain
