{verse 1}
[D] Running through the snow with [A] reckless abandon
[G] Tail wagging, tongue hanging [D] out
[Bm] You're a giant in a [A] winter wonderland
[G] Frolicking and rolling [D] about

{chorus}
[D] Oh, English Mastiff in the [A] snow
[G] You're a sight to [D] behold
[Bm] Playing like a pup [A] once again
[G] Your spirit never [D] grows old

{verse 2}
[D] Snowflakes falling all a[A]round
[G] Your coat white as the [D] snow
[Bm] You're a gentle giant [A] at play
[G] In this winter wonder[D]land below

{bridge}
[Bm] You may be big and [A] strong
[G] But your heart is pure and [D] true
[Bm] In the snow, you belong
[G] With your playful spirit [D] anew

{outro}
[G] Running through the snow, [D] playing in the cold
[Bm] Your spirit never fades [A] away
[G] English Mastiff in the snow, [D] forever young at heart
[Bm] Your playful spirit is here to [A] stay.
