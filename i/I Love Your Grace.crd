{Title: I Love Your Grace}

{Verse}
[G]I love Your [F]grace,
I love Your [C]mercy
[G]I love the way You [F]help me when I [C]call [D]
[G]I love the [F]truth,
I love the pow[C]er of Your [Am]name
But You [F]know I love Your [C]presence most of [G]all.

{Chorus}
[A#]My soul takes ref[F]uge
in the sha[C]dow of Your wings
[F]Close to You is [C]where I want to [G]be
[A#]You are my [F]strength,
you are my [C]God, you are my [Em]King
[F]All I want is [C]what You want for [D]me.
