{Title:All Who Are Thirsty}
{Verse}
All who are [D]thirsty, All who are [F#m]weak
Come to the [G]fountain
Dip your heart in the [Em]stream [F#m]of [G]life

Let the [A]pain and the [D]sorrow
Be washed a[F#m]way
In the waves of His [G]mercy

As deep cries [Em]out [F#m]to [G]deep [A]... (we sing)

{Chorus}
[D]Come Lord Jesus, [G]come,
[D]Holy Spirit [G]come
As deep cries [Em]out [F#m]to [G]deep
