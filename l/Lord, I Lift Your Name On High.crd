{Title:Lord, I Lift Your Name on High}

{Verse}
[G]Lord, I [C]lift Your name on [D]high, [C] [G]
Lord, I [C]love to sing Your [D]praises, [C] [G]
I'm so [C]glad You're in my [D]life,  [C] [G]
I'm so [C]glad You came to [D]save us.


{Chorus}
[G]You came from [C]heaven to [D]earth, to [C]show the [G]way.
From the [C]earth to the [D]cross, my [C]debt to [G]pay,
From the [C]cross to the [D]grave,
From the [Em]grave to the [Am]sky,
Lord I [D]lift Your name on [G]high!
